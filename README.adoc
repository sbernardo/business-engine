== Introduction

Business Engine is a framework for developing business logic requirements structured, configurable and customizable.

=== How it works

The *Business Engine* is built on two basic concepts, *rules* and *groups*.
The main features are:

* Parsing a single json that represent the entire business logic
* Perform a user-friendly configuration by web app
* Use the recent release of Spring framework (Spring-boot 2.7+)
* Possibility to write logic in configuration without deploy nothing (see xref:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/core.html#expressions[SpelExpression])
* Provides a mechanism of execution:
** For each group in configuration execute rules (ordering specified in configuration)
** If rule is blocking, stop current group execution
** If there are no other rules to execute, jump to next group

NOTE: Work in progress...
